- Why the power symbols looks like the power symbol
- 0s and 1s combined 'icon'


### Core Principles
- Computers run on electricity.
- Electricity has 2 discrete state. On and Off
- We can create coding scheme for 'on and off' states'
  - Example: Morse code, Halloween trick or treat / go away.

- 2 ^ n
- 0 - off
- 1 - on
- Power icon -> 0 and 1 combined / off and one.
