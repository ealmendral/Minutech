  - var x int

- assign - assign a value to a variable

- initialize - declare & assign an initial value to a variable
  - var y int 
  - y = 10

- identifier - name of the variable

- operator - character that represents an action

  - Made of expressions


- expression - a value, or operations (operands and operators) that express a value.
 - a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value.
 - Example:  2 + 8 is an expression which evaluates to 10.
 - x:= 2+ 8 
 - y:= 99  // 99 here is also an expression as it's a value.


- parens  - ( )

- curly braces "curlies"  - {  }
