### Dependency Management

 > is the process of identifying, organizing and resolving the external code libraries and packages that a software application or project depends upon. Most software applications depend on a large number of external code libraries or packages, which are maintained by third-party developers.
 
 > Dependency management is important because it ensures that all required libraries and packages are available and compatible with each other and that any updates or changes to those dependencies are managed and controlled to prevent issues that could arise due to **conflicting versions** or changes.

 > There are various tools and techniques for managing dependencies in programming, including package managers such as **npm** for Node.js, **pip** for Python and **Maven** for Java. These tools allow developers to easily install, update and remove external dependencies for their projects, and also provide features like version control, dependency resolution, and automatic updates.


 > A module is a piece of code that may be built upon, a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of pre-written code, and a framework is a set of principles for developing applications.

 - In go we create modules
  - go mod init
 - Modules have packages
 - namespacing  - [domain,repo]
 

### Spaghetti Code
 > Spaghetti code refers to a programming code that is complex, tangled and difficult to understand and maintain. The term spaghetti code is often used to describe code that has been written in haphazard and unstructured manner making it difficult for other programmers to understand and modify the code.
 > It typically arises when the programmer does not follow a structured approach to software development and fails to organize the code into modular, reusable components. This can lead to software that is unreliable, inefficient, and prone to errors.
 > The term "spaghetti code" is derived from the visual appearance of the code, which resembles a tangled mess of lines that are difficult to trace and follow, similar to a plate of spaghetti.
 > To avoid spaghetti code, it is important for programmers to follow best practices for software development, such as structured approach, creating modular components, and documenting their code thoroughly.



### Modular Code / Structured Programming
 > A **structured approach** to software development is a methodical and organized approach to writing software code. It involves breaking down a large softwware project into smaller, manageable tasks, and approach is to make the code more readable, maintanable and scalable, which helps to reduce errors and improve software quality.
