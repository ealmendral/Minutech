### Dependency Management

 > is the process of identifying, organizing and resolving the external code libraries and packages that a software application or project depends upon. Most software applications depend on a large number of external code libraries or packages, which are maintained by third-party developers.
 
 > Dependency management is important because it ensures that all required libraries and packages are available and compatible with each other and that any updates or changes to those dependencies are managed and controlled to prevent issues that could arise due to **conflicting versions** or changes.

 > There are various tools and techniques for managing dependencies in programming, including package managers such as **npm** for Node.js, **pip** for Python and **Maven** for Java. These tools allow developers to easily install, update and remove external dependencies for their projects, and also provide features like version control, dependency resolution, and automatic updates.


 > A module is a piece of code that may be built upon, a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of pre-written code, and a framework is a set of principles for developing applications.

  - go mod init
 - Modules have packages
