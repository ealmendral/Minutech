### Data Types

- We Declare a variable of a certain type
- go is  a statically typed

- basic type / built-in type / primitive type
  - data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block.
  - Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be constructed starting from basic types
  - In most programing languages, all basic data types are built-in

- aggregate types
 - may values together
 - array, slice, struct
 - composite / compound / structure / struct type
  - include values of different types
 - act of constructing a STRUCT which is a composite type is known as composition
