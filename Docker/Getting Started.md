### What is Docker and Why?

- container technology
- tool for creating and managing containers
- Container - standardized unit of software 


### Why Containers
- Different Development and Production environments
- Should be easy to share Development environments
- Tools should not clash in versions


### Virtual Machines vs Containers

- Virtual Machines = OS -> Virtual OS -> Libraries, Dependencies, Tools -> Application
  - Waste a lot of space on your hard drive and tends to be slow
- Docker = OS -> OS built-in / Emulated Container Support -> Docker Engine -> Containers [ Libraries, Dependencies, Tools] -> Applications 

### Setup
 - Follow documentation
 - Docker Playground
