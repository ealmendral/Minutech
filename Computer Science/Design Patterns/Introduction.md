### What's a Design Pattern?
 - Typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
 - They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve recurring design problem in your code.
 - The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
 - You can follow the pattern details for your programs.


### Pattern vs Algorithm
 - Both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems.
 - Algorithm - always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal.
 - Pattern - is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.


### Analogy
 - Algorithm is a cooking recipe.
 - Pattern is  more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.
