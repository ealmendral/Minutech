## Why know Data Structures?
 - It is a core subject for Programmers / IT professional.
 - Working as a programmer we use Data Structure in application development.
 - We cannot develop applications without Data Structures.

## At what Level should one Study Data Structurs
 1. Level 1: You know what these data structures are and how they work?
 2. Level 2: You know how they work in detail, and you are able to do the analysis.
    - Understand in depth, what are the operations they perform.
    - You know how those operations are performed.
    - You know the internal detail.
    - You are able to analyze them based on time and space complexity.
    - You understand throughly.
 3. Level 3: You know everything in detail, and you know how to code them.
    - You can develop your own data structures.
    - You need programming practice.

  - **This guide cover so that you can be a Level 3.**

## What is Data Structures?

 - Program is set of instructions which performs operations on data.
 - Without data, instructions cannot be performed.
 - Data is important part of program.
 - When a programmer dealing with the data, how it organize data in main memory.
 - **The way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program.**


<hr />

### Components of a Computer System
 - CPU - executes the program
 - Main Memory
    - has the program code 
    - has the data 


 - program code will perform operations on the data.
 - How we arrange the data so that it can be best (efficiently) utilize by the program.
 - ** Arrangement of data is Data Structure ** 
 - Depending on your requirement  of a program, type of procedure, we have different data structures.


<hr />

### List of Data Structures
 1. Physical Data Structures - define how data are **arranged** in memory. 
  - Arrays
  - Matrices
  - Linked List

 2. Logical Data Structures  - define how data can be **utilize**.
  - Stack
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hashing

 3. Sorting
 4. Recursion



<hr />

### Algorithm
 - Steps to implement these Data Structures
 - Algorithm is a vast topic, Google and Facebook has their own algorithms.
 - This guide is for the Algorithms applied to listed Data Structures above.

 ### Programming and Problem Solving is Different
  - Programming can be learned in few days
  - Problem Solving is a lifetime work
  - Programming is a syntax
  - Problem Solving is thinking
